> Stipop provides a powerful and flexible sticker API that enables companies to add stickers onto their apps and websites with minimum effort and maximum effect.

You can now add stickers into your apps and websites in forms of library (simple download), store (paid sticker purchase), and profile by using Stipop Sticker API. Here in this repository we have put into files instructions to using the API for such products. Once you decide which API product to use, you can sign up in our home page (https://stipop.io) and get access to a unique API Key instantly.

Stickers are one of the most powerful visual contents you can find in the digital world. With more than 50 billion being sent everyday, it brings emotion into online communicaton and social behaviors. Because stickers are created by an artist with a specific purpose, they are very unique, usable and tailored to all tastes. 

Seeing how sticker is a useful kind of media, we as a team started a platform, where stickers and sticker lovers can play about. Our product began as an app for messenger users to download stickers for their personal use. Now that there is more than 5,000 sticker artists participating from 25 different countries and the total stickers accumulate to 100,000 we wanted other companies to able to provide stickers to their own users.
