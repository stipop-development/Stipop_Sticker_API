> Stipop provides a powerful and flexible sticker API that enables companies to add stickers onto their apps and websites with minimum effort and maximum effect.

Stickers are one of the most powerful visual contents you can find in the digital world. With more than 50 billion being sent everyday, it brings emotion into online communicaton. Because stickers are created by an artist with a specific purpose, they are very unique, usable and tailored to all tastes. 

Seeing how sticker is a useful kind of media, we as a team started a platform, where stickers and sticker lovers can play about. Our product began as an app for messenger users to download stickers for their personal use. Now that there is more than 5,000 sticker artists participating from 25 different countries and the total stickers accumulate to 100,000 we wanted other companies to able to provide stickers to their own users.
