> Stipop provides a powerful and flexible sticker API that enables companies to add stickers onto their apps and websites with minimum effort and maximum effect.

You can now add stickers into your apps and websites in forms of library (simple download), store (paid sticker purchase), and profile by using Stipop Sticker API.

Stickers are one of the most powerful visual contents you can find in the digital world. With more than 50 billion being sent everyday, it brings emotion into online communicaton and social behaviors. Because stickers are created by an artist with a specific purpose, they are very unique, usable and tailored to all tastes.

Our product began as an app for messenger users to download stickers for their personal use.
